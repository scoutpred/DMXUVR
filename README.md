# DMXUVR - Dance Maniax Update VR Companion
## A VR Companion for AllenSeitz's Dance Maniax Update, made with Unity.

# What is it?
A Unity program that allows you to emulate DMX Update into the VR space. Simply put, you can now play Dance Maniax Update in VR!

Compatible with Quest 2. At the moment, I am not sure if it works for other headsets.

# How do I run it?
-Start off with installing Dance Maniax Update [here!](https://github.com/AllenSeitz/dance-maniax-update) Make sure to follow the instructions.

-Open DMX.exe, then open DMXUVR. Focus on DMX.exe while DMXUVR is running.

-There are buttons on each side:

**Top Left Side:**

-Insert Coin

**Bottom Left Side**

-P1 Left

-P1 Enter

-P1 Right

**Top Right Side:**

-Test Screen

**Bottom Right Side:**

-P2 Left

-P2 Enter

-P2 Right

# Bugs?

## A lot, for now.

-Apparently, playing in Center is all screwed up, probably right too. Might fix this in the future.

-Cursor capture is left on. Will disable this one in the next patch.

-In some cases, the companion won't read DMX.exe. Restart the companion and DMX.exe just to be sure.

# Future Features? (Feel free to contribute!)

-Adjustable Sensors

-Hands!

-Height Adjustment

-Proper button models

-Probably a machine model by someone

-More to come.
