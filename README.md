# DMXUVR - Dance Maniax Update VR Companion
## A VR Companion for AllenSeitz's Dance Maniax Update, made with Unity.

# What is it?
A Unity program that allows you to emulate DMX Update into the VR space. Simply put, you can now play Dance Maniax Update in VR!

Compatible with Quest 2. At the moment, I am not sure if it works for other headsets.

# How do I run it?
- Start off with installing Dance Maniax Update [here!](https://github.com/AllenSeitz/dance-maniax-update) Make sure to follow the instructions.

- Extract the DMXUVR anywhere you want it to be. It doesn't necessarily have to be in the Dance Maniax Update folder. The only thing that should reside in the Dance Maniax Update folder is...

- (As of v.1.0.1) ...the copy the DMX_VRcomp.exe in the root directory of your Dance Maniax Update installation.

- Open DMX_VRcomp.exe, then open DMXUVR via Meta Quest Link (be sure to add it in the list of apps!). Make sure to keep focus on DMX.exe while DMXUVR is running.

# Bugs?

## A lot, for now.

-~~Apparently, playing in Center is all screwed up, probably right too. Might fix this in the future.~~ Managed to touch the source code from the dance-maniax-update repo to change the input mappings. A separate executable called DMX_VRComp.exe is added in the RAR file. Follow installation instructions. It should be compatible for VR now. Go play Double!

-~~Cursor capture is left on. Will disable this one in the next patch.~~ Removed!

-In some cases, the companion won't read DMX.exe. Restart both the companion and DMX.exe just to be sure.

-Properly adjusting the sphere/hand models right at your hands's locations!

-Latency issues? Not sure if it's me. Give it a check!

# Future Features? (Feel free to contribute!)

-Adjustable Sensors (size, height, distance between each sensor)

-Hands!

-Player Height Adjustment

-Proper button models

-Probably a machine model by someone

-More to come.
